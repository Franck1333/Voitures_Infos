# Voiture_Infos SubProject Arduino - *"Simple_OLED_GPS"*

This small Sub-project is aim to use the Arduino power with the TiniGPS++ lib to get some informations come from the NEO-6M GPS made for Arduino boards.

## Getting Started  
  
You can download or Copy/Paste the Source code (.ino) into your Arduino I.D.E to test this code on your hardaware.
  
### Prerequisites  
  
To use the project, you will need some Hardware :
  
```  
An Arduino Board	(here: Arduino Nano, https://tinyurl.com/arduinoMiniboards)
An OLED Screen 		(here: 128 x 32, https://tinyurl.com/oledscreenarduinopouce)
A  NEO-6M GPS		(here: Come with Antenna, https://tinyurl.com/ArduinoGPS6M)
```  
 *Also, a breadboard or PCB and also Wires and tools needed to solder.*
 
  And you will also need some libraries and softwares :

```
- An Arduino IDE Up to date,
- An Arduino board,
- And don't forget to install lib needed.
```
## Run
#### The Way to run the project :

 1. To run the project; You need to compile and upload the Source code
    to the Arduino Board by using the Arduino IDE

 2. When it's done, you should assembly all the component on a
    breadboard or solder all the components on a PCB

 3. When the last step is done, You must Power on by pluggin an USB power source to your Arduino boards and if you didn't make any mistakes , It's Works.

## Running the tests  
  
That's how to test the program:
Use the Arduino IDE with your files

    <file>.ino

## The Folders and Files
#### Files in "/Simple_OLED_GPS/"

Main features of the program
```
- Simple_GPS_OLED.ino: That's main program.
- Simple_OLED_GPS.fzz: The fritzing document scheme.
- Simple-OLED-GPS-bb.pdf: That's the scheme of the numeric thermometer.
- Simple-OLED-GPS-bom.html: This is the list of components needed for this project.
```
